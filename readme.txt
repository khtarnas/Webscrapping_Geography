************************************* Notes *************************************

- Main.java is what you run to get the input requests: it deals with all inputs and redirecting to the correct
 functions
- Questions.java contains the functions that answer each question individually, as well as helper methods and set
 up functions
- nameAndNumberLists.java is a separate class made to associate arrayLists of different types since this isn't
possible in java (why no tuples of abstract types??) and handles the joint sorting of the two lists that is used in
three different questions

************************************* Assumptions *************************************

- Over time, even as information gets updated, the names of div classes, etc. will not be changed
- If a color is in the flag description, it is in the flag. 
- For question 6, the assumption is that the Carribean is a "region" which I'm defining as just a looser version of
 a continent (so 'Central America' and 'Middle East', etc. would work as well).
