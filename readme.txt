************************************* Notes *************************************

- Main.java is what you run to get the input requests: it deals with all inputs and redirecting to the correct
 functions
- Questions.java contains the functions that answer each question individually, as well as helper methods and set
 up functions
- nameAndNumberLists.java is a separate class made to associate arrayLists of different types since this isn't
possible in java (why no tuples of abstract types??) and handles the joint sorting of the two lists that is used in
three different questions

- Overall, once I got the hang of some of the funky parts of JSoup, this was a pretty smooth assignment. The main
parts that I had difficulty with were when there were inconsistencies between pages (something like the html was
slightly different between guam and angola or a certain part of a page just doesn't exist for a specific country).
In these cases, I tried to handle them as well as I could, but that often meant just ignoring cases that were funky.
There are definitely also inputs that the user could give (meaning nonsensical ones) that I tried to handle, but at
times they will just pass through.

************************************* Assumptions *************************************

- Over time, even as information gets updated, the names of div classes, etc. will not be changed
- If a color is in the flag description, it is in the flag.
- For question 6, the assumption is that the Carribean is a "region" which I'm defining as just a looser version of
 a continent (so 'Central America' and 'Middle East', etc. would work as well).
